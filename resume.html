					<h2>Data Scientist II, GEICO, Chevy Chase, Maryland</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">01/2023 - Now</p>
					<p>
					•	Spearheaded the development of innovative machine learning and AI initiatives, including the creation of an intelligent knowledge assistant bot, next-best-action (NBA) recommendation system, and real-time customer intent detection and entity extraction models (RIDE) for GEICO’s customer-facing virtual assistant. These contributions were pivotal in realizing over $20 million in net benefits and cost savings.<br>
•	Leveraged a diverse array of machine learning methodologies, including natural language processing (NLP) and generative AI for conversational applications, churn prediction models, tenure regression analysis, and clustering for in-depth customer profiling, as well as utilizing reinforcement learning for dynamic strategy optimization, among other techniques.<br>
•	Demonstrated exceptional dedication and efficiency by working closely with cross-functional teams—comprising data scientists, engineers, and analysts—to deliver the RIDE project a month ahead of a stringent deadline. Concurrently, achieved a 97% accuracy rate in customer intent detection using NLP and classification methods, significantly outperforming third-party benchmarks of 85%. This dual success in delivering faster and more accurate solution facilitated significant cost savings of approximately $1.5 million.<br>
•	Designed and executed automated data pipelines to support model training, scoring, monitoring, and backtesting, ensuring the scalability and efficiency of machine learning operations across the board.<br>
•	Provided expertise and technical assistance across projects, leveraging in-depth knowledge of insurance domain, infrastructure, and technical aspects to support the team, enhancing project outcomes and operational efficiency.<br>
•	Fostered strong collaboration with various departments including Machine Learning Orchestration (M20), Machine Learning Operations (MLOps), Marketing, Product, and IT, guaranteeing seamless integration and delivery of machine learning projects.<br>
